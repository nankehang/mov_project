## ✅ Quick Test

   npm run dev
   ```

## 📊 Database Schema

Your `Product` model already supported this:
```javascript
{
  photo_path: String,        // Main image (single)
  gallery: [String],         // Gallery images (array)
}
```

No database migration needed! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Gallery not showing"
- Check product actually has gallery images in database
- View product detail page, not just card
- Refresh page after adding images

### "Upload failing"
- Check image size < 5MB
- Verify file is JPG/PNG/GIF/WebP
- Check DigitalOcean Spaces credentials in `.env.local`
- Look for errors in browser console

### "Images loading slow"
- Compress images before upload (use TinyPNG, etc.)
- Use WebP format for smaller files
- Check internet connection

## 🎯 Example Workflow

```
Admin adds new "Wireless Headphones" product:

1. Main Photo: Front view of headphones
2. Gallery Image #1: Side profile
3. Gallery Image #2: Earcup close-up (padding detail)
4. Gallery Image #3: Person wearing headphones
5. Gallery Image #4: Box contents/packaging

Customer views product:
→ Sees main photo on homepage
→ Clicks "View Product"
→ Large gallery with 5 images total
→ Navigates with arrows/thumbnails
→ Gets complete visual understanding
→ More likely to purchase! 💰
```

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Consistency**: Use same background/lighting for all images
2. **Order matters**: Most important angle = gallery image #1
3. **Mobile first**: Test on phone - most customers shop mobile
4. **Alt text**: Product name used for accessibility
5. **Lazy load**: Large galleries load progressively (already built-in!)

## 📱 Mobile Experience

Gallery is fully responsive:
- ✅ Touch-friendly arrow buttons
- ✅ Swipeable image carousel
- ✅ Dot indicators for position
- ✅ Optimized thumbnail size
- ✅ Fast loading with image optimization
