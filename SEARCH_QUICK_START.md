## 💡 Tips

- Use **client mode** for your current catalog size (faster UX)
- Switch to **server mode** when you have 1000+ products
- The search is **smart**: ignores extra spaces, case differences
- **Empty search** shows all products (no filter applied)
- **Special characters** are escaped for security
